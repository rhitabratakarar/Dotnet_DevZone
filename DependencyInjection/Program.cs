// This is the DI Container (to know, read the comment below).

/* Why Dependency Injection?
 * 
 * Traditionally, we created tightly coupled code by directly creating concrete instances of classes within other classes. 
 * 
 * For example:
 * 
 * In class A:
 * ClassB objectB = new ClassB(); // calling ClassB directly.
 * 
 * This approach makes the code harder to maintain and extend. If you modify one section of the code, there's a high possibility 
 * of breaking the existing codebase.
 * 
 * The solution? *Enter the Dependency Injection (DI) design pattern.*
 * 
 * In dependency injection, there are three entities:
 * 
 * 1. Client (Client.cs) - The first entity is the client, which requires a service. Here, "IClient" is an interface representing the client entity, 
 * and "Client" is a class implementing the "IClient" interface.
 * 
 * 2. Service (Service.cs) - The second entity is the service that provides functionality to the client. For example, "IService" is an interface 
 * representing the service, and "Service" is a class implementing the "IService" interface.
 * 
 * 3. Container (DI Container) (Program.cs) - The last entity is the container, which is responsible for injecting the dependency (Service) 
 * through constructor dependency injection pattern. The DI container is a part of a DI framework and provides a centralized 
 * way to manage dependencies and their lifetimes throughout the application.
 * 
 * This design pattern is popularly implemented by many modern frameworks, including ASP.NET Core, but it's not limited to any specific framework.
 * 
 * The approach is simple: a class should not directly create instances of another class it depends on; instead, the "to-be-used class" 
 * is injected by the DI container. This creates low coupled code that is easier to extend and maintain.
 * 
 * The approach looks like this:
 * 
 * (Here, "Service" is implementing "IService" interface.)
 * IService serviceToInject = new Service(); 
 * 
 * (The "Client" is implementing "IClient" interface and has a constructor taking an "IService" serviceToInject parameter.)
 * (This is constructor dependency injection.)
 * IClient clientThatWantsService = new Client(serviceToInject); 
 * 
 * (Call the client method that is implemented by the "Client" class from "IClient")
 * clientThatWantsService.ConsumeInjectedService();
 *
 * Things to note: 
 * 
 * The Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP) is an enabler of the Dependency Injection principle.
 * 
 * DIP states that high-level modules/classes should not depend on low-level modules/classes directly. Instead, both should depend 
 * on abstractions (interfaces or abstract classes).
 * 
 * By programming to interfaces, you can easily switch implementations without modifying the client code.
 * 
 * The design pattern can be considered as follows:
 * 
 * There is a class that has a job to perform and requires a service for that. An abstraction of that service is required through 
 * its constructor (constructor dependency injection). Once the class receives the service, it can perform computations with it. 
 * Instead of instantiating the service by itself, it delegates this responsibility to someone else (the DI container).

IService serviceToInject = new Service();
IClient client = new Client(serviceToInject);  // the dependency injection in action.
client.UseDependency(); // IClient has the UseDependency member, thus able to call it.

// It will print the output (IF NOT MODIFIED):
// 38
// This is inside service method
